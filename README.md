# HoloControl
HoloLens input device based on Wii Nunchuk controller.
- Adds two buttons and joystick functionality
- Wireless connection over Bluetooth
- Low latency, reaction time < 1/20 second
- Easy to use in Unity, no external dependencies

## How it works

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cazacov/HoloControl/master/img/overview.png" alt="Overview" width="860" height="140"/>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cazacov/HoloControl/master/img/overview.png "Overview")


- Arduino board reads button state from nunchuk over I2C protocol.
- Arduno translates key press events in [USB HID codes](http://www.freebsddiary.org/APC/usb_hid_usages.php) and sends them to EZ-Key board over serial interface.
- Bluefruit EZ-Key board appears like an external keyboard in the list of available Bluetooth devices on the HoloLens.
- Standard Bluetooth pairing, no PIN required. If something goes wrong there is Pair button on the EZ-Key board to restart the connection.
- For Unity scripts the HoloControler looks like normal key press events coming from a keyboard.


First prototype

## Hardware


### Parts list
| Part | Price in EU | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wii Nunchuk | 10 € | Got one in perfect condition on Ebay |
| Arduino Mini 3.3V/8MHz | 9.50 € | Reads data from the Nunchuk |
| Bluefruit EZ-Key | 21 € | Bluetooth HID Keyboard Controller |

You will also need FTDI cable to program Arduino Mini. It's also possible to [use regular Arduino as programmer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoMini).

### Wiring

Wired version

It's also possible to make it completely mobile by adding LiPo accumulator and charge controller, but then you'll need a 3D printer to print bigger case.

Arduino stacked on the top of EZ-Key board. I put a piece of plastic between boards for electrical isolation.

Nunchuk board pinout.

Electronics nicely fits into original nunchuk case.

## Firmware

Arduino sources are in the "Arduino" folder.

The easiest way to program Arduino Mini is using FTDI cable. It's also possible to use USB<->Serial adapter or Arduino UNO as programming device.

Be sure to choose correct board type in the Arduino IDE

## Using in Unity

The controller simulates keys strokes on a Bluetooth keyboard. Joystick directions are translated in A, D, W, S keys. Z button is mapped to Return and C button to Escape. 

You can get key state with the standard UnityEngine.Input class:

```csharp
if (UnityEngine.Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A))
{
	// Joystick left
	...
}

if (UnityEngine.Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D))
{
	// Joystick right
	...
}
```

Demo Unity project is included.


## Wired version
Still needs cable for power supply (USB plug A).

## Wireless version

Adds LiPo accumulator and charging controller.

Coming soon.
